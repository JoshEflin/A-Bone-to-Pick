 ## As a dog lover
 ## Given a website created to adopt dogs
 ## When I search for a dog by breed 
 ## Then I am taken to a results page which contains cards with Dogs images, their name, age, and a photo, as well as specifics about the dogs breed
 ## When I click on the dogs image
 ## Then I am taken to another page with more detailed information about that specific dog, its current location, and any relevant information regarding adoption
 ## When I am on the results page or the Detailed dog info page And click "share me"
 ## Then That dogs card and energy levels are added to local storage so that when I want to view all the dogs I have shared I see all the dogs I have shared

# A Bone To Pick

## Description

A bone to pick was built as a card collecting game to help dogs in need. As shelters are overloaded we made use of the petfinder api to find dogs local to your area and the dog api from API ninja to collect stats and share them with your friends. 

In the future we would like to add to this site by possibly setting up battles which would let local shelters know of specific dogs getting more attention.

After that just type in your zipcode and the breed of dog youd like to pull up the ones closest to you. When you click a dog to get more information on contact info and adoption they will be saved to your 'pack'. We added a feature to share either one specfic dog or your entire pack via atob and btoa in javascript.
