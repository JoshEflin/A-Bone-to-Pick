# A Bone To Pick

## Description

A bone to pick was built as a card collecting game to help dogs in need. As shelters are overloaded we made use of the petfinder api to find dogs local to your area and the dog api from API ninja to collect stats and share them with your friends. 

In the future we would like to add to this site by possibly setting up battles which would let local shelters know of specific dogs getting more attention.

## User Story

```
As a dog lover
I WANT to collect dog adoption playing cards
SO THAT dogs in need of homes gain attention and get adopted

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```

GIVEN a website created to adopt dogs
WHEN I search for a dog by breed 
THEN I am taken to a results page which contains cards with Dogs images, their name, age, and a photo, as well as specifics about the dogs breed
WHEN I click on the dogs image
THEN more info appears to the side with contact info for the dog shelter and I save the dog to my collection (via local storage)
WHEN I am on the results page or the Detailed dog info page And click "share me"
THEN That I get a "secret code" to send to a friend
WHEN my friend inputs their secret code
THEN that brings up the specific dog
WHEN I click on share my pack
THEN through the same technology I can share my whole collection

```

## Usage

To enter into the main site you will boop the nose of our dog!

After that just type in your zipcode and the breed of dog youd like to pull up the ones closest to you. When you click a dog to get more information on contact info and adoption they will be saved to your 'pack'. We added a feature to share either one specfic dog or your entire pack via atob and btoa in javascript.
